Amy Ranbarger   

  She fully believes that with the right haircut, you can conquer anything. She loves building the client’s confidence up by perfecting the cut they want. A haircut is more than just a haircut to her. It is someone’s wedding day, prom, funeral, job interview, kid’s first haircut, someone’s last haircut, a bad day turned into a good day, and so forth. With her attention to detail, you will leave with a cut that you wanted or better. She is a former Marine so her favorite style to do are military cuts. But, can cut any current trend. She is eager to learn new things and a hard worker.
