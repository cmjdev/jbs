You know in those old movies, where the barber lays the guy back in the chair and wraps a Hot Towel around his face...? You guessed it! We do that!

Our “Hot Towel Shave” is for the guy that seeks that Nostalgic Barber Shop feel!

We start with a moisturizing cream,followed by a Hot Towel to relax and soften the face. Then we apply our warm Lather. We’ll gently stretch the skin to assure a smooth and comfortable Straight Razor Shave. Once your face is smooth,we apply a vanishing cream and another Hot Towel. We’ll double check your skin for any missed hairs and apply aftershave!
